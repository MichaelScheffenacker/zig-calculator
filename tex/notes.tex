\section{Prime Factorization}

Brute force calculation of primes failed;
even the first $10^5$ take 10\,s here on Witt\-gen\-stein.

Proper prime factorization algorithms that factorize numbers above $10^{100}$ would at least require to look into number theory and algebra.
Apparently implementation of such algorithms took something in the order of years rather than months.

A better idea might be to implement a prime sieve to calculate a sufficient number of primes and then brute force divide through the numbers.


\subsection{Sieve of Eratosthenes}
This is the simplest sieve which just removes all multiples of each prime number (within the array).
A simple and efficient lookup might be an array with all numbers up to the upper bound.
A reasonable upper bound might be $2^{33} = 8\,589\,934\,592$ .
This should safely allow to factorize all numbers up to $(2^{33})^2 = 2^{66} = 73\,786\,976\,294\,838\,206\,464$
[better check by investigating the largest primes smaller than this numbers].

Utilizing an array with the full range of numbers allows to identify the offset as the value of the number,
therefore the array's value can be used as boolean prime indicator.

\begin{verbatim}
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    ^ first prime: 2

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
        ^   ^   ^ multiples of 2

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
      ^ prime: 3

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
            ^     ^     ^     ^ multiples of 3

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
          ^ prime: 5

...
\end{verbatim}

[apparently the smallest untouched multiple of a new prime is its square, might want to include that ...]

More ideas:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Condensate eight Booleans into a byte; would reduce memory usage to an eighth. To evaluate the overhead of extracting the values would require testing.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Lower numbers would require to bitwise-and their primality out of the byte.
  \item In the range of larger numbers, prime numbers get more sparse.
  The last prime number before $2^{33}$ is 8\,589\,934\,583.
  According to Wolfram Alpha 8\,589\,934\,583 is the 393\,615\,806\textsuperscript{th} prime number.
  This means on average up to this prime number about every 22\textsuperscript{nd} number is prime.
  So even if the prime numbers were evenly spread over this range almost two out of three bytes would be zero,
  allowing a simple, initial zero check before having to bitwise-and the number.
  (If this this actually more efficient is questionable since the bitwise and should be cheap anyways
  while transferring the data from memory might be the expensive operation.)
  \item Another idea:
  If most of the bytes are zero anyways there might be a relatively simple function that identifies the offsets of most of the zero bytes.
  In this case running this function from cache might be faster than fetching all this data from main memory.
  On the other hand the prefetcher might nullify this advantage.
 \end{itemize}
 \item Skip every second value.
 Since, except for two, even numbers are not prime anyways,
 skipping every even number should half calculation time and memory space.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{2024-09-16}

Numbers up to $2^{33}$ obviously requires 64 bit unsigned integers;
to save space it might be sufficient to utilize prime numbers up to $2^{32}$.
The largest prime number smaller than $2^{32}$ is $2^{32} - 5 = 4\,294\,967\,291$
which is the 203\,280\,221\textsuperscript{st} prime number.
Therefore an array holding all primes numbers up to $2^{32} - 5$ as unsigned 32 bit integers would require around 800\,MB.
The closest prime number below $(2^{32} - 5)^2$ is $(2^{32} - 5)^2 - 2 = 18\,446\,744\,030\,759\,878\,679$.
But integers greater than this number can still be factorized by utilizing $2^{32} - 5$
since the division of $(2^{32} - 5)^2 - 2$ will fail
and therefore render it prime.
But for larger integers divisions will succeed
since they are not prime and therefore prime numbers up to $2^{32} - 5$ will factorize them.
The first number this will fail is the first prime number larger than $(2^{32} - 5)^2$
which is $(2^{32} - 5)^2 + 40 = 18\,446\,744\,030\,759\,878\,721$.
Therefore every integer up to 18\,446\,744\,030\,759\,878\,720 can be factorized by the set of all prime numbers up to $2^{32} - 5$.

\subsection*{2024-09-19}
Okay, we need some nomenclature here:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $B_{32} := 2^{32} = 4\,294\,967\,296$ one above the largest \texttt{unsigned integer}
 \item $B^-_{32} := B_{32} - 5 = 2^{32} - 5 = 4\,294\,967\,291$ the largest prime number smaller than $B_{32}$ (203\,280\,221\textsuperscript{st} prime number)
 \item $B^+_{32} := B_{32} + 15 = 2^{32} + 15 = 4\,294\,967\,311$ the smallest prime number larger than $B_{32}$ (203\,280\,222\textsuperscript{nd} prime number)
 \item $B_{\dot{64}} := {B^-_{32}}^2 = (2^{32} - 5)^2$
 \item $B^-_{\dot{64}} := B_{\dot{64}} - 2 = (2^{32} - 5)^2 - 2 = 18\,446\,744\,030\,759\,878\,679$
 \item $B^+_{\dot{64}} := B_{\dot{64}} + 40 = (2^{32} - 5)^2 + 40 = 18\,446\,744\,030\,759\,878\,721$
\end{itemize}


There is an error in the considerations above:
Primes numbers larger than $B_{\dot{64}}$ can actually be detected
since finding no prime divisor up to $B^-_{32}$ simply means the number in question is prime;
this is true up to the smallest number that has two prime factors larger than $B^-_{32}$.
(For example this is not true for $B^-_{32}\cdot B^+_{32}$
since $B^-_{32}$ is in the \texttt{prime number array}
and after the division the result is $B^+_{32}$ which turns out to be prime and the factorization is complete.)
The smallest number composed of the smallest two prime numbers larger than $B^-_{32}$ is ${B^+_{32}}^2 = 18\,446\,744\,202\,558\,570\,721$.
${B^+_{32}}^2$ is 171\,798\,692\,000 larger than $B^+_{\dot{64}}$,
the former candidate for the upper limit of the prime factorization with factors up to $B^-_{32}$.

\subsection*{2024-09-23}

\newcommand{\PP}{\mathbb{P}}
\newcommand{\NN}{\mathbb{N}}
\newcommand{\TT}{\mathbb{T}}
\newcommand{\Bm}[1]{B^-_{32}}
\newcommand{\Bp}[1]{B^+_{32}}
\newcommand{\set}[1]{\lbrace \, {#1} \, \rbrace}
\newcommand{\Set}[2]{\set{ {#1} \;|\; {#2} }}

Let's try to bring this into a more formal form.
$\PP$ the Set of all prime numbers.

$$\PP_{\Bm{32}} = \Set{p}{p \in \PP \leq \Bm{32}}$$

$$\PP_{\Bp{32}} = \Set{p}{p \in \PP \leq \Bp{32}} = \set{2, 3, 5, \dots, \Bm{32}, \Bp{32}}$$

$$\PP_{x} \coloneq \Set{p}{p \in \PP \leq x \in \PP}$$

$n \coloneq |\PP_x|$; $p_i \in \PP$

$$\PP_{p_n}
= \set{2, 3, 5, \dots, p_n}
= \set{p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_{n-1}, p_n}$$

An integer $x \in \NN \geq 2$ is called factorizable by $\PP_{p_n}$
if either all prime factors $p_i$ of $x$ are in $\PP_{p_n}$
or if by utilizing $\PP_{p_n}$ it can be guaranteed that $x$ is prime itself
and therefore its only prime factor.
Any $x$ is factorizable by $\PP$ since by definition
if it is not it is prime itself.
But because $\PP_{p_n}$ is bounded there are $x$ larger than $p_n$
that have prime factors larger than $p_n$ and can potentially not be factorized.
It might seem like no number larger than $p_n$ can be factorized by $\PP_{p_n}$
since any power of two can be factorized by any $\PP_{p_n}$.
In fact any number with $m_i \in \NN_0$ that has the form

$$2^{m_1} \cdot 3^{m_2} \cdot 5^{m_3} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_{n-1}^{m_{n-1}} \cdot p_n^{m_n}
= \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{m_i} $$

is factorizable by $\PP_{p_n}$.
\st{The Sieve of Eratosthenes utilizes a similar principle
to remove all non prime numbers from its set.}
[Eratosthenes removes all multiples of any prime number of the set.
This means that also any higher primes larger than $p_n$ are removed.
But somehow (up to $p_n$?) all the numbers are met.
There might lie the core of the proof?!]

\subsection*{2025-01-24}

\subsubsection*{Attempt of some basic definitions}

\emph{Prime factorizations} are from now on simply called \emph{factorizations}.

\emph{The set of all prime numbers} $\PP = \set{2, 3, 5, 7 \dots }$.

The convention to use from now on lowercase p only for prime numbers $p \in \PP$.

\emph{Factorization Set} is a set of consecutive prime numbers that can be utilized to factorize integers.

$$\PP_{x} \coloneq \Set{p}{p \leq x \in \PP}$$

$n \coloneq |\PP_x|$

$$\PP_{p_n}
= \set{2, 3, 5, \dots, p_n}
= \set{p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_{n-1}, p_n}$$

The set of all natural numbers greater or equal than $2$ and less or equal than $m$ are called a \emph{Test Set}.

$$[m] \coloneq \set{2, 3, \dots, m}$$

The \emph{factorizability of a natural number} $x \in \NN \ge 2$ by a Factorization Set $\PP_{p_n}$
means that there is a (efficient) algorithm utilizing the numbers of this set to factorize the natural number.
The \emph{factorizability of a Test Set} $[m]$ means that that the Factorization Set has the ability to
factorize all numbers in the Test Set.
The Factorization Set $\PP_{p_n}$ has in general the ability to factorize multiple Test Sets;
the set off all this Test Sets is $\TT_{p_n}$.

$$\TT_{p_n} \coloneq \Set{t}{t\text{ is factorizable by }\PP_{p_n}}$$

\subsubsection*{Reasoning}

The question is now, what is the largest Test Set $[m^{p_n}_{max}]$ of $\TT_{p_n}$.
$\PP_{p_n}$ is obviously able to factorize $[p_n]$ since $\PP_{p_n}$ contains all prime numbers in $[p_n]$.
If $x \in [p_n]$ is a prime number, it will simply be factorized into itself $x \in \PP_{p_n}$.
If $x$ is not a prime number, it will be factorized into multiple prime numbers $p_i$.
Since the product of prime numbers is greater than each of its factors,
each of those prime numbers has to be smaller than $x$, therefore each $p_i \in \PP_{p_n}$.

At this point we assume that the algorithm for factorization executes the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Try to divide consecutively by each prime number $p_i \in \PP_{p_n}$.
 \item If the integer division is successful, try to repeat the division.
 \item If the integer division is not successful anymore, continue to the next $p_i$.
 \item In any case after a successful integer division the residual value is 1, the factorization is complete.
 \item If after the last $p_i$ (which is $p_n$) the residual value is still larger than 1, the factorization failed.
\end{itemize}
